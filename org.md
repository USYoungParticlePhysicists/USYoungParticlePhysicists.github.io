# What is Snowmass Early Career (SEC)?
SEC is an organization of early career members in the HEP community. The goals are two-fold: 1) to represent early career 
members and promote their engagement in the Snowmass 2021 process and 2) to build a long-term HEP early career community 
that persists after the Snowmass process.

## Key Initiatives
We are organized into five key initiatives:

*In-reach:* Professional development and building cohesion within the early career community

*Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI): Work on initiatives to make the HEP community representative, welcoming, inclusive, 
and equitable

*Survey: Survey the early career membership

*Long-Term Organization: Define the long-term structure of the early career organization after the Snowmass process

*Snowmass Coordination: Coordinate with the Snowmass frontiers and help get early career members involved in the Snowmass process
All of these key-initiatives will engage with the Snowmass process and 1-4 will remain as a standing HEP early career representative 
body post-Snowmass. For example, the DEI initiative would mainly contribute and plug-in to existing efforts in the community frontier 
during Snowmass, but after Snowmass, it would be a standing part of the early career committee that persists.
