#SNOWMASS EARLY CAREER

Snowmass Early Career (SEC) is composed of early career members in the particle physics community. As a guideline, 
SEC roughly defines early career as ~10 years post-PhD. However, we recognize that many people have different paths 
that can include career gaps and changes. We thus encourage anyone that feels that early career applies to them to join 
the organization. We also encourage those involved in the technical, operations, or engineering aspects of HEP experiments 
who may or may not obtain a PhD as part of their career path to join. The Snowmass 2021 process will develop a long-term 
strategic plan, so the voices of early career members are critically important and we want them to be heard.

SEC Leadership
The SEC leadership consists of the current and previous year DPF executive committee early career members and 2-3 leaders per 
key initiative (except for Snowmass Coordination). For the Snowmass Coordination group, each frontier will have 2-3 liaisons.
